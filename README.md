# cloud-filesystem-ui
This is an angular project. All rights are reserved to https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin. So i only used it for viewing my microservice applications. By downloading the "Empty starter kit" version from https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin/tree/starter-kit, I have added two menus and still keep on adding some extra menus to it.
